Documentation is still lacking, but it is currently under development.

If you need help, please email me at hhefesto at rdataa dot com, and I might be able to put together a tutorial for you.

Currently available documentation:

- [Haddock Documentation](/docs/haddock/index.html)
- [Specification of the Telomare language (before called Stand-In-Language)](/docs/sil-specification.pdf)
